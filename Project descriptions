🕳️ Pothole Detection System using OpenCV | For Municipal Corporation & Smart Vehicles

This repository contains a Python-based Pothole Detection System designed for deployment in municipal corporation vehicles, road inspection units, and smart transportation systems.

The system processes video frames in real-time, uses OpenCV for image operations, NumPy for matrix processing, and time module for performance measurement.
It can be integrated into government surveillance vehicles to automatically detect potholes on roads and generate alerts.

🚀 Features
✔ Real-Time Pothole Detection

Works on live webcam feed or pre-recorded road videos

Uses thresholding, contour detection, and edge detection techniques

Marks pothole regions with bounding boxes

✔ Lightweight & Fast

No heavy deep-learning model required

Optimized using OpenCV + NumPy

Works well on low-power devices (Raspberry Pi, laptops in vehicles)

✔ Modular & Extensible

Easy to integrate with:

GPS modules

Municipal dashboards

Embedded systems

Cloud reporting tools

✔ Practical Use Case

Designed specifically for:

Municipal road inspection vehicles

Smart city infrastructure systems

Automatic road-maintenance alert systems

⚙️ How It Works
1. Frame Capture

The system captures video frames using:

cv2.VideoCapture(0) for live camera

Or a video file path

2. Preprocessing

Each frame is processed using:

Grayscale conversion

Gaussian blur

Edge detection (Canny)

Thresholding for dark pothole regions

🎯 Output Example

Potholes highlighted with rectangles

FPS displayed on the frame

Real-time detection


3. Contour Detection

Contours representing potholes are extracted using:
